Electric motors with promising features such as high torque capability, low cost, fault tolerance, reasonable power factor, modularity, etc. can be easily
integrated into the structure of electric vehicles. Various electric motors can provide such criteria for vehicle manufacturers. One of them is the switch
reluctance motor about which many recent research studies talked. Although the switch reluctance motor (SRM) is a reputable candidate for transportation 
applications, one should be careful about the annoying torque ripple in these motors. In the context of machine design, various methods have been implemented
to palliate the cogging torque and torque ripple of SRMs. These strategies usually consider either drive or machine design to tackle the torque ripple problem.
The drive tackling is very straightforward and the basic is to inject the required harmonic to face the torque ripple-producing forces. Therefore, it's 
applicable after the machine design has finished and the machine is ready for test in the laboratory. Without an appropriate drive, the designer would not be
able to improve the performance. On the other hand, the machine design strategy, also utilized in this project, is implemented in the machine design procedure.
The user would be able to drive the motor without any further consideration. Therefore, the cost of implementation of this method is much less than the first one.
